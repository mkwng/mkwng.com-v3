            The profile picture is the introduction to your digital identity. It’s the first thing that people see when they visit your profile to form an impression about you, and as a result people spend a lot of time and thought into which picture they use to represent themselves. It’s been one of the main holdover features since Facebook launched, and unlike the rest of the platform around it, the format of the profile picture has mostly remained unchanged. One square-ass photo.
          </p>

          <p class="w-100 w-50-ns pr3-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            Yet, that one square-ass photo is, for many, one of the most important portraits of who they are. Research and data show that many people on Facebook pick a picture and stick with it for months, even years. To find a picture worthy of a profile pic, the curation is painstaking, and the bar is high. Yet, a picture of you is static. Your identity is not. A picture doesn’t capture the nuance of a person, her beliefs, her personality. And that’s where our team came in. 
          </p>
          <p class="w-100 w-50-ns pl3-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            At Facebook, I created, with much help from the talented people surrounding me, the Self Expression team in 2014. We were one product designer (me!), a product manager, an engineering lead, 3 engineers, and a data scientist, and we tasked ourselves with the goal of helping people use their Facebook profiles to better capture and share their identity. We also gave ourselves a target: The profile picture. We were going to tear. It. Up.

            But, how do we get from here to there?
          </h2>
          <p class="w-100 w-50-ns pr4-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            The vision was there, but the path to get there was, at the beginning, a little hard to see. To make profile pictures better was worthy enough of a goal, but how do we turn that into concrete action? Well, there are many articles out there that describe the process of ideation and creativity. A lot of them lay them out much better than I could, and we used many of those processes ourselves. We ideated, we prototyped, and we validated. I do, however, want to call attention to how we decided two features in particular:
            <br /><br />
            The first was temporary profile pictures. The thing you have to understand is that the momentum was already there; people were already using their profiles in creative ways that we never planned. When more than 26 million people used the Celebrate Pride filter on their profile pictures (a quick hack that another team put together) to show their support for the LGBQT community, it felt like being wondrously slapped in the face by a big golden feature-request fish. 
          </p>
          <p class="w-100 w-50-ns pr4-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            People wanted to represent the causes they believed in, and they wanted it now. (But maybe not always, so maybe temporary, yay.) The research backed it up, and it aligned with our goals. It was on.
            <br /><br />
            The second started off as a joke. An engineer we worked with had acquired a little bit of infamy by hacking his own internal FB profile to display his profile as a video. It was simple, just a looping gif of him spinning in his chair, yet it was one of those things that made you just linger a little longer on his profile. It was something that made your imagination run, and made you realize maybe this is something you didn’t know you wanted.
            <br /><br />
            We landed, with confidence, on our roadmap moving forward. Along with some other ideas, we were going to make profile pictures disappear, and then we were going to make them boogie.

            When you identify a common pattern of usage of a product that was not part of the original scope, often times it's a clue that your product has another need that it's not optimized for.
            <br /><br />
            Talk to your users and examine their behavior. Take a step back and drop your notions of what you think you're doing. Examine what problem they are solving for themselves, and ask if there's something you can do.

            As these things go, however, a seemingly simple change turned out to be a fairly massive task. A lot of it was technical, and a lot of it was institutional. The technical stuff was obvious. I don’t know if there’s any formal measure of this, but the Facebook application is unscientifically the most complex in the App Store. (Source: me, thinking about it really hard.)
            <br /><br />
            There was also the other side. Profile Pictures haven’t changed because they’ve worked really well. Were we going too far? Was making them into videos our MySpace moment? At the same time, we had to display utmost respect to legacy decisions, and account for pre-existing features and optimizations. We had to account for the goals of our partner teams while fighting for our own. 
            <br /><br />
            Finally, we needed to validate our decisions. We established what our MVP was, what our metrics were, determined what we would consider a success. Were we, even slightly, improving the Facebook experience for our users?

Today, that company is a transportation platform that provides thousands of rides a week to clients all across the board. Our company, Teleport Dashboard makes it easy for anyone from businesses to individuals to run their own car service without any of the overhead.

            The funny thing is, we didn’t start off looking to help improve the corporate transportation market. With my cofounder Bob’s experience as an investor in the social space, and my background at Facebook, we were intent on improving friendship quality. It’s not materially relevant, yet it’s worth noting the space was on fire; There were sky high valuations of other players in the social market, as larger companies like LinkedIn and Salesforce were recognizing (and acquiring) the business applications of personal networks. 
            <br /><br />
            That said, along with our third and final cofounder, Victor, we were in on it because we wanted to create something valuable we would personally use. In fact, we had t-shirts of our values printed on them, among them: “Bring people closer together.”

          <p class="w-100 w-50-ns ph3-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            We felt strongly about our goal, and we tried a lot of things. We built a lot of prototypes and we ran a ton of user tests. We brought on subject matter experts, and we tried a lot of ideas. Things that we designed/tested/built: CRM for your friends. A social feed with intelligent AI curation. A social game where you tag your friends with qualities. A private journal for your relationships. A business tool that informed you of important life events in your network. We learned a ton. Yet, along various stages of development, it felt like we were hitting a wall.
            <br /><br />
            As we struggled for traction, we constantly challenged our own assumptions, looking for lessons in the products that we launched and in the weekly user testing sessions. Funny thing is… the key insight? It was printed on our t-shirts the entire time.

              At lunch one day, we joked about how silly it was, what we were doing. All our research and experience told us that the best way to improve relationships was to meet face to face. Yet, our attempt to improve real life relationships involved people staring their screens. Chuckling at the irony (and in between bites of Halal Guys), Eugene, our iOS engineer, joked, “What if there’s a button on my phone that I can push, and then my friends show up at my door?” 
              <br /><br />
              We laughed. Then a few seconds of silence. Didn’t Uber just announce their API last month? Furious Googling ensued, until finally, “I think we can actually make this work.” 2 weeks later, we had a working prototype. 2 months later, we were in the App Store.
              <br /><br />
              ProductHunt picked us up as soon and we ended the day #1 in their rankings with the most amount of votes. Media outlets like Lifehacker, Fortune Magazine, and Elite Daily wrote exuberant articles about us. Even Uber complimented us on our original use of their API. I think we hit on something that the tech world craved: It was emblematic of how the progression of technology enabled zany new applications. Chris Sacca, famed investor, tweeted our product with the caption: “Teleportation is real!” It was novel, it was interesting, and best of all, it was funny.

            But, how do we get from here to there?

          <p class="w-100 w-33-ns pr4-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            While we saw a surge of interest and downloads from the press we received, those downloads did not translate into engaged, active users. We saw constant turnover, and a lot of users never even sent their first ride. It was an interesting problem to solve; people loved the idea enough to install it and create an account, but we couldn’t “activate” them into real users. We put our noses to the grindstone and set out to fix that.
          </p>
          <p class="w-100 w-33-ns ph3-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            In the meantime, emails started coming in from doctors’ practices, hotel concierges, and more. There were so many businesses that saw our product, shared their experience about how they hacked their Uber app to accomplish close to what Teleport did, and asked if we were creating a business application. It was very interesting, but at the time, we were focused on trying to make our app sticky. We took those emails, went, “huh, cool,” and set it aside for future consideration.
          </p>
          <p class="w-100 w-33-ns pl4-ns mb0 f6 fw3 lh-copy">
            We kept our path until the MTA came along. They were interested in working with us, and potential volume they were looking to send alone dwarfed our current engagement numbers. Maybe it took a little too long for us to realize this, but it became clear that there was a real market with real money if we solved this problem for them. So, we refocused. In April 2016, we publicly launched Teleport Dashboard.
